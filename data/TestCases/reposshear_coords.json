Must be a 3-by-3 matrix since pore coordinates are\n        always in 3D.  If this is given then the other individual arguments\n        are ingnored.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    rotate_coords\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The shear along the i *th* -axis is given as i\\\\* = i + aj.  This means\n    the new i coordinate is the old one plus some linear factor *a* in the\n    j *th* direction.\n\n    The values of ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are essentially the inverse of the\n    slope to be formed by the neighboring layers of sheared pores.  A value of\n    0 means no shear, and neighboring points are stacked directly on top of\n    each other; a value of 1 means they form a 45 degree diagonal, and so on.\n\n    If ``S`` is given, then is should be of the form:\n\n    ::\n\n        S = [[1 , ay, az],\n             [bx, 1 , bz],\n             [cx, cy, 1 ]]\n\n        where any of the off-diagonal components can be 0\n\n    \"\"\"\nif S is None:\n    S = np.array([[1, ay, az], [bx, 1, bz], [cx, cy, 1]])\nnetwork['pore.coords'] = (S @ network['pore.coords'].T).T\n"

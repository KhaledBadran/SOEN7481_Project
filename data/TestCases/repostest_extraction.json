Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production\n                        workloads at Google , combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\nPlanet Scale\nDesigned on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes\n                    can scale without increasing your ops team.\nNever Outgrow\nWhether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to\n                    deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.\nRun Anywhere\nKubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public\n                    cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.\nThe Challenges of Migrating 150+ Microservices to Kubernetes\nBy Sarah Wells, Technical Director for Operations and Reliability, Financial Times\nWatch Video\n    \"\"\"\nwith open('test.html') as html_file:\n    html = html_file.read()\nextractor = ArticleExtractor()\nextracted_text = extractor.get_content(html)\nassert expected.strip() == extracted_text.strip()\n"

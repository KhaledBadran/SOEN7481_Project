This\n    method is useful for abnormal shaped throats.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    target : OpenPNM Object\n        The object which this model is associated with. This controls the\n        length of the calculated array, and also provides access to other\n        necessary properties.\n\n    throat_length and throat_area : strings\n        The dictionary keys containing the arrays with the throat area and\n        length values.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    value : NumPy ndarray\n        Array containing throat volume values.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    At present this models does NOT account for the volume reprsented by the\n    intersection of the throat with a spherical pore body.\n\n    \"\"\"\nleng = target[throat_length]\narea = target[throat_area]\nvalue = leng * area\nreturn value\n"

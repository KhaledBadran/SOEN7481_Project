It can also be used for convolutions with higher\n    dimensionalities by using it individually for each axis.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    input_length : int or None\n        The size of the input.\n\n    filter_size : int\n        The size of the filter.\n\n    stride : int\n        The stride of the convolution operation.\n\n    pad : int, 'full' or 'same' (default: 0)\n        By default, the convolution is only computed where the input and the\n        filter fully overlap (a valid convolution). When ``stride=1``, this\n        yields an output that is smaller than the input by ``filter_size - 1``.\n        The `pad` argument allows you to implicitly pad the input with zeros,\n        extending the output size.\n\n        A single integer results in symmetric zero-padding of the given size on\n        both borders.\n\n        ``'full'`` pads with one less than the filter size on both sides. This\n        is equivalent to computing the convolution wherever the input and the\n        filter overlap by at least one position.\n\n        ``'same'`` pads with half the filter size on both sides (one less on\n        the second side for an even filter size). When ``stride=1``, this\n        results in an output size equal to the input size.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    int or None\n        The output size corresponding to the given convolution parameters, or\n        ``None`` if `input_size` is ``None``.\n\n    Raises\n    ------\n    ValueError\n        When an invalid padding is specified, a `ValueError` is raised.\n    \"\"\"\nif input_length is None:\n    return None\nif pad == 'valid':\n    output_length = input_length - filter_size + 1\nelif pad == 'full':\n    output_length = input_length + filter_size - 1\nelif pad == 'same':\n    output_length = input_length\nelif isinstance(pad, int_types):\n    output_length = input_length + 2 * pad - filter_size + 1\nelse:\n    raise ValueError('Invalid pad: {0}'.format(pad))\noutput_length = (output_length + stride - 1) // stride\nreturn output_length\n"

This model could be applied to conduits such as\n    cuboids or cylinders in series in true 2D simulations.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    target : OpenPNM Object\n        The object which this model is associated with. This controls the\n        length of the calculated array, and also provides access to other\n        necessary properties.\n\n    pore_diameter : string\n        Dictionary key of the pore diameter values\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    EP : dictionary\n        Coordinates of throat endpoints stored in Dict form. Can be accessed\n        via the dict keys 'head' and 'tail'.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This model is only accurate for cubic networks without diagonal\n    connections.\n\n    \"\"\"\nreturn cubic_pores(target, pore_diameter=pore_diameter)\n"

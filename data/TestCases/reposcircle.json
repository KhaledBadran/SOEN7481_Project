    "Body": "\"\"\"\n    Calculates internal surface area of pore bodies assuming they are circular\n    then subtracts the area of the neighboring throats in a crude way, by\n    simply considering the throat cross-sectional area, thus not accounting\n    for the actual curvature of the intersection.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    target : OpenPNM Object\n        The object for which these values are being calculated.  This\n        controls the length of the calculated array, and also provides\n        access to other necessary thermofluid properties.\n\n    pore_diameter : string\n        The dictionary key to the pore diameter array.\n\n    throat_area : string\n        The dictioanry key to the throat area array.  Throat areas are needed\n        since their insection with the pore are removed from the computation.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    value : NumPy ndarray\n        Array containing pore surface area values.\n\n    \"\"\"\nnetwork = target.project.network\nR = target[pore_diameter] / 2\nAsurf = 2 * _np.pi * R\nTn = network.find_neighbor_throats(pores=target.Ps, flatten=False)\nTsurf = _np.array([_np.sum(network[throat_area][Ts]) for Ts in Tn])\nvalue = Asurf - Tsurf\nreturn value\n"
